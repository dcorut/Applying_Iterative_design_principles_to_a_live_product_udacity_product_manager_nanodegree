Project Description:

Iterative Design & The Future of Flyber: A Path Forward
In the past 6 months, your team worked tirelessly to launch the first flying car app, Flyber, to customers across New York City. The app has been something of a steep hit with the core group of flyers you launched with.

You've decided it's time to step up and lay out a plan for how you're going to identify paths forward which give you the best chance at success. You pitch the team on an iterative design process that brings qualitative and quantitative techniques together in order to minimize industry-standard risk types so that you can move forward confidently.
